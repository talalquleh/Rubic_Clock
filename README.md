# Rubiks_Clock
A simple game using Java <br/>
<h2>Task Description</h2>
Create a game, which implements the Rubik clock. In this game there
are 9 clocks. Each clock can show a time between 1 and 12 (hour only).
Clocks are placed in a 3x3 grid, and initially they set randomly. Each
four clocks on a corner has a button placed between them, so we have
four buttons in total. Pressing a button increase the hour on the four
adjacent clocks by one. The player wins, if all the clocks show 12.
Implement the game, and let the player restart it. The game should
recognize if it is ended, and it has to show in a message box how much
steps did it take to solve the game. After this, a new game should be
started automatically.
